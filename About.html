                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Welcome to my portfolio page. Here I will be linking and demonstrating various projects I have worked
                    on.
                    Some of these were assignments from Codecademy, others are just things I wanted to see if I could
                    make.
                    <br><br>
                    I have worked in IT for eight years now, mostly service desk and now some System Administration.
                    Though
                    I have always had a goal of breaking into development. I really enjoy learning new skills and I
                    believe
                    development is a great career path for continual learning.
                    <br><br>
                    I am married with a son on the way, which is all very exciting. In my free time I like to game,
                    leaning
                    more towards indie games. I also read fantasy and play D&D whenever I can.
